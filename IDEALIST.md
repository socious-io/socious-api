Before running the script:
Run the migration to add new columns into projects table.
Columns 'other_party_id', 'other_party_title' and 'other_party_url' are required for this script.
For testing purposes, you can insert a timestamp of 1-3 days ago at the .env file in the IDEALIST_SINCE. Without this timestamp, the script will require the last updated_at timestamp from the database from the idealist. If such record is not found, it will download records from idealist from its start.
The column updated_at in the projects contains the records from idealist, and it is used to get the last saved Idealist project for continuation in the next cyclus of loading projects.
