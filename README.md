## Development Process

When working on a task create a new branch `username/task-name`. For example if you are working on adding a new login strategy create a branch name such as `john/identity-facebook-strategy`.

Once branch is pushed create a new PR against `main`. Title it using `type(topic): feature name` such as `feature(strategy): add facebook strategy`.

You may want to create the initial PR in draft mode while you are working on the feature. Once it is ready to review set the PR to ready and ping a dev for review.
